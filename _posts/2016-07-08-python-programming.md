<hr />

{% include _toc.html %}

There are entire books devoted to this topic, so I don't try to repeat them here.

This page contains the "I wish I had known this" type of tips and tricks.

PEPs (Prython Enhancement Proposal) 8

   * Two empty lines before a new class declaration
   * Function names are all lower case, not Camel-case like Java and C#

These are integrated into IDEs, such as Pycharm from Jetbrains.com

   * https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/download/#section=mac


## Print time #

Print out the current time:

   <pre>
   import time
   time.ctime()
   </pre>

   The response:

   <tt>
   'Sat Jan 28 00:35:27 2017'
   </tt>


### Break time program

Pengal 
<a target="_blank" href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud036/">
Programming Foundations with Python course at Udacity</a>
consists of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4MUG4dOepc&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnYajEbZvqtcVWQ6XGhvtOW">
videos on YouTube</a> and forums.

<pre>
import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 3
break_count  = 0  

while( break_count < total_breaks ):
   time.sleep(10) # seconds
   webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnYajEbZvqtcVWQ6XGhvtOW")
</pre>


## Strings

The Unicode standard represents a large variety of characters beyond the roman alphabet 
(emojis, greek, russian, mathematical symbols, logograms from non-phonetic writing systems such as kanji, etc.)

Define a Unicode string with a prefix, then print a unicode string:

   <pre>
unicode_string = u"aaaàçççñññ"
encoded_string = unicode_string.encode('utf-8')
print encoded_string
   </pre>
